This TODO file is ancient. 




TODO: remove HTML5 dependency on synchronous file loading (check SCRIPT command for problems)

TODO: curved arrows overextend and with width settings do not truncate shaft properly

TODO:  The label offset for POV-ray is problematic. The problem is that the labels are 
floating in front of the model, and I recently switched POV-ray export to export in 
orthographic mode and let POVray handle the perspective. This was important for 
other reasons. But as a result, a label floating in space in front of the atom will 
appear at a different location. An interesting challenge to figure out the algorithm 
that still places it in the "proper" place even when perspective is on. (Daniele Tomerini)


TODO: image (not found)  stops JSmol

TODO: consider if models with no atoms will cause issues in relation to model.firstAtomIndex

TODO: isosurface molecular has an issue with 2gb1

TODO: slab SET will not be rendered correctly when exported because tm.transformPoint

TODO: If you create a PNGJ file t.png and then  load it and save it again as a stanadard PNG file, 
      then it will be broken, because its script will be calling for an external file that has the
      same name, and it no longer has file data in it. 
      
TODO: vector traces saved in state?

TODO: slightly stronger unitcell lines for near point?
