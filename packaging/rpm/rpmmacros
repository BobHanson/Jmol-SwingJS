# Custom RPM macros configuration file for building RPM packages
# as a non-root user.
#
# Author:  Mike A. Harris <mharris@redhat.com>
#
# This is a copy of my own personal RPM configuration which I use
# on my workstation for building and testing packages for Red Hat Linux.
# There are many different possibilities on how to configure RPM, so
# feel free to tweak however you desire.  Make sure to create any
# directories that are referenced prior to using.  RPM will automatically
# create some of them if missing, but not all of them.  Which ones it
# auto-creates is only known by the extraterrestrial aliens that have
# created RPM.
#
# For ANY help with anything related to RPM development, packaging,
# or customization, please join the Red Hat RPM mailing list by sending
# an email message to:  rpm-list-request@redhat.com  with the word
# "subscribe" in the Subject: line.
#
# Any suggestions/comments/ for improvements to this setup appreciated.

# %_topdir defines the top directory to be used for RPM building purposes
# By defaultROOT of the buildsystem
%_topdir	%(echo $PWD)

# %_sourcedir is where the source code tarballs, patches, etc. will be
# placed after you do an "rpm -ivh somepackage.1.0-1.src.rpm"
%_sourcedir     %{_topdir}

# %_specdir is where the specfile gets placed when installing a src.rpm. I
# prefer the specfile to be in the same directory as the source tarballs, etc.
%_specdir       %{_sourcedir}


# %_tmppath is where temporary scripts are placed during the RPM build
# process as well as the %_buildroot where %install normally dumps files
# prior to packaging up the final binary RPM's.
%_tmppath	%{_topdir}/tmp

# %_builddir is where source code tarballs are decompressed, and patches then
# applied when building an RPM package
%_builddir	%{_topdir}/BUILD

# %_buildroot is where files get placed during the %install section of spec
# file processing prior to final packaging into rpms.  This is oddly named
# and probably should have been called "%_installroot" back when it was
# initially added to RPM.  Alas, it was not.  ;o)
%_buildroot	%{_topdir}/%{_tmppath}/%{name}-%{version}-root

# %_rpmdir is where binary RPM packages are put after being built.
%_rpmdir	%{_topdir}/RPMS

# %_srcrpmdir is where src.rpm packages are put after being built.
%_srcrpmdir	%{_topdir}/SRPMS

# %_rpmfilename defines the naming convention of the produced RPM packages,
# and should not be modified.  It is listed here because I am overriding
# RPM's default behaviour of dropping binary RPM's each in their own
# separate subdirectories.  I hate that.  Grrr.
%_rpmfilename	%%{NAME}-%%{VERSION}-%%{RELEASE}.%%{ARCH}.rpm

# Customized tags for local builds
# %packager is the info that will appear in the "Packager:" field in the
# RPM header on built packages.  By default I have it read your username
# and hostname.  This should be customized appropriately.
# %packager	Joe Blow <joe@blow.com>
%packager	%(echo ${USER}@)%(hostname)
%distribution	Personal Build

# GNU GPG config below
#%_signature     gpg
#%_gpg_name      Joe Blow <joeblow@somewhere.com>
#%_gpg_path      %(echo $HOME)/.gnupg


# The following will try to create any missing directories required above
