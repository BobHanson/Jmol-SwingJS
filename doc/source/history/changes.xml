<changes version="jmol-0.5">
  <change contributor="DG"> Numerous small bug fixes.</change>
  <change contributor="DG,EW"> FileSaver, XYZSaver and CMLSaver classes are new.  You can now 
  save the current structure to either XYZ or CML formats.</change>
  <change contributor="DG"> Package name is now org.openscience.jmol.</change>
  <change contributor="EW"> Modifications to the CML parsing routines to use the new

  thanks to E.L. Willighagen</change>
  <change contributor="DG"> Many internal changes in the AtomType JTable supporting
  classes to reverse some stupid decisions I made early on. </change>
  <change contributor="DG"> AtomTypeTable now stores the AtomType information as a
  resource </change>
  <change contributor="DG"> Changes in AtomTypeTable headers to support multiple line
  headers </change>
  <change contributor="DG,CS"> StatusBar is now a 3-wide set of JLabels that post more
  useful information </change>
  <change contributor="DG"> Swing 1.1.1 Beta 2 (HTML labels if we want to use them)</change>
</changes>


<changes version="jmol-0.3">
  <change contributor="DG"> PhysicalProperties (Charges, NMRShieldings, Vectors,
  etc.) can be set by the file readers.  Christoph Steinbeck 
  asked for this originally when he wrote GaussianFile.  It was 
  a good idea, and was worth the extensive rewrite. </change>
  <change contributor="DG"> Swing 1.1.1 Beta 1 (fixes some annoying bugs for Java 1.1 
  users) </change>
  <change contributor="CS"> The GaussianFile class has been updated to read general 
  Gaussian files (not just G98) and to automatically compute 
  chemical shifts using stored ab initio values for 
  tetramethyl silane's chemical shift. </change>
  <change contributor="DG"> Some bug fixes.</change>
  <change contributor="DG"> Shaded bonds that look like cylinders.  Well, at least they look
  a little bit like cylinders. End caps would be a nice addition, but
  I've been a bit busy lately.</change>
  <change contributor="DG"> FileTyper and ImageTyper accessories for JFileChooser make
  choosing file types more sensible than just using the filename
  filter.  These classes were rationalized after 0.2 had
  already been released.  They also listen to the JFileChooser
  to try to guess what kind of file you just selected (only
  if UseFileExtensions is set).</change>
</changes>

<changes version="jmol-0.2">
  <change>Many internal changes.</change>
  <change contributor="DG">Jmol has moved to a new home.  I've been working on a web
  site called "The OpenScience Project", and have registered a
  domain for it, so Jmol is the first of the software projects
  that is housed at www.openscience.org </change>
  <change contributor="CS"> Christoph Steinbeck contributed a new input filter for
  Gaussian 98 log files, complete with a parser for NMR chemical
  shifts.</change>
  <change contributor="DG">The file readers now subclass a more general (but very
  simple) ChemFile class.  This should make addition of other file
  readers easier.</change>
  <change contributor="DG">File Type selection is no longer dependent on the file's
  extension.  You can select a "*.jnk" file and explicitly 
  tell Jmol what kind of file it is when opening the file. </change>
  <change contributor="DG">There is a strange interaction between fillPolygon in jdk1.2
  and the X server under Solaris x86.  (And circles under jdk1.2
  look lumpy on many architectures.)  I've built a workaround into
  Jmol which involves talking directly to the Graphics2D object
  underlying the display panel to set some Rendering hints.  This
  workaround has the benefit of making some really nice
  pictures when you want high quality (but lower speed).  If you
  have jdk1.2, turn on AntiAliasing in the Preferences to see the
  difference.  An unfortunate side effect is that you now need the
  jdk1.2 classes to compile (but not run) Jmol. </change>
  <change contributor="DG">A Jpeg encoder has been added. The JpegEncoder and its
  associated classes are Copyright (c) 1998, James R. Weeks and
  BioElectroMech.  This software is based in part on the work of
  the Independent JPEG Group.</change>
  <change contributor="DG">Build process now uses a Makefile.</change>
  <change contributor="HG">The Makefile now has the ability to create javadocs of 
  the source code.</change>
</changes>

<changes version="jmol-0.1.1">
  <change contributor="DG">Removed the extra double-buffering that resulted from not
  understanding that Swing components are automatically
  double-buffered. This resulted in substantial performance
  improvements.</change>
  <change contributor="DG">Fixed some depth strangeness in the drawn atom
  sizes.</change>
  <change contributor="DG">Fixed the bonds so that they render more realistically as
  the molecule is being rotated.  End caps for the bonds are
  still in progress.</change>
  <change contributor="DG">Reordered the toolbar buttons and added a button for
  molecule deformations that will eventually do something
  useful. </change>
</changes>

<changes version="jmol-0.1">
  <change contributor="DG">There are some major new features, so the minor version number 
  has been incremented. </change>
  <change contributor="DG">Atom Types are now editable using "Atom Properties" in the
  Edit Menu.  This added a large chunk of interface code to do the
  JTable and cell editors and column sorters.  The edited atom
  types are saved in the .jmol directory under the user's home
  directory.</change>
  <change contributor="DG">The Preferences dialog now saves preference info in the 
  .jmol directory under the user's home directory.</change>
  <change contributor="DG">Reorganization of classes into a jar file.</change>
  <change contributor="DG">An atom selection mechanism now is working.</change>
  <change contributor="DG">Reorganization of source: BondTypeTable is gone, BondType is
  now replaced by Bond.  Many other changes for new
  AtomTypeTable. </change>
  <change>Silly little Splash screen, but it makes startup feel faster
  when there is something popped up on the screen almost
  immediately.</change>
  <change contributor="DG">There is now a "Front" item in the View menu.  The View 
  menu actions are not intuitive yet, so they will be changing 
  in a future version. Don't get used to them.</change>
  <change contributor="DG">There is a new "fast forward" button in the Animate dialog 
  that takes the animation to the last frame.</change>
  <change contributor="DG">The Rewind, FastForward, Next, and Previous buttons in the
  Animate dialog now stop the animation when they are pushed. 
  </change>
  <change>Swing version incremented to 1.1</change>
