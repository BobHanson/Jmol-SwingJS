SYMMETRY           (determine point group)
      
      Note that exact point-group symmetry is a
      mathematical idealization. NBOModel recognizes
      'effective' symmetry, adequate for chemical
      purposes even if actual atom positions deviate
      slightly (say, ~0.02A) from idealized symmetry.
