   * Consolidated Geodesic from dotsRenderer 3/19/07 Bob Hanson
   * 
   * Constructs a canonical geodesic sphere of unit radius.
   *<p>
   * The Normix3D code quantizes arbitrary vectors to the vectors
   * of this unit sphere. normix values are then used for
   * high performance surface normal lighting
   *<p>
   * The vertices of the geodesic sphere can be used for constructing
   * vanderWaals and Connolly dot surfaces.
   *<p>
   * One geodesic sphere is constructed. It is a unit sphere
   * with radius of 1.0
   *<p>
   * Many times a sphere is constructed with lines of latitude and
   * longitude. With this type of rendering, the atom has north and
   * south poles. And the faces are not regularly shaped ... at the
   * poles they are triangles but elsewhere they are quadrilaterals.
   *<p>
   * A geodesic sphere is more appropriate for this type
   * of application. The geodesic sphere does not have poles and 
   * looks the same in all orientations ... as a sphere should. All
   * faces are equilateral triangles.
   *<p>
   * The geodesic sphere is constructed by starting with an icosohedron, 
   * a platonic solid with 12 vertices and 20 equilateral triangles
   * for faces. The internal call to the private
   * method <code>quadruple</code> will
   * split each triangular face into 4 faces by creating a new vertex
   * at the midpoint of each edge. These midpoints are still in the
   * plane, so they are then 'pushed out' to the surface of the
   * enclosing sphere by normalizing their length back to 1.0
   *<p>
   * The sequence of vertex counts is 12, 42, 162, 642, 2562.
   * These are identified by 'levels', that run from 0 through 4;
   * The vertices
   * are stored so that when spheres are small they can choose to display
   * only the first n bits where n is one of the above vertex counts.
   *<code>
   * Faces + Vertices = Edges + 2
   *   Faces: 20, 80, 320, 1280, 5120, 20480
   *     start with 20 faces ... at each level multiply by 4
   *   Edges: 30, 120, 480, 1920, 7680, 30720
   *     start with 30 edges ... also multipy by 4 ... strange, but true
   *   Vertices: 12, 42, 162, 642, 2562, 10242
   *     start with 12 vertices and 30 edges.
   *     when you subdivide, each edge contributes one vertex
   *     12 + 30 = 42 vertices at the next level
   *     80 faces + 42 vertices - 2 = 120 edges at the next level

   * geodesic level 0 vertexCount= 12 faceCount=20 edgeCount=30
   * geodesic level 1 vertexCount= 42 faceCount=80 edgeCount=120
   * geodesic level 2 vertexCount= 162 faceCount=320 edgeCount=480
   * geodesic level 3 vertexCount= 642 faceCount=1280 edgeCount=1920
   *
   *</code>
   *<p>
   * The vertices of the 'one true canonical sphere' are rotated to the
   * current molecular rotation at the beginning of the repaint cycle.
   * That way,
   * individual atoms only need to scale the unit vector to the vdw
   * radius for that atom.
   *<p>
   *
   * Notes 27 Sep 2005 </br>
   * If I were to switch the representation to staring with
   * a tetrahedron instead of an icosohedron we would get:
   *<code>
   * Faces: 4, 16, 64, 256, 1024
   * Edges: 6, 24, 96, 384, 1536
   * Vertices: 4, 10, 34, 130, 514
   *</code>
   * If I switched to face-centered normixes then I could efficiently
   * Regardless, I think that face-centered normixes would also reduce
   * ambiguity and would speed up the normal to normix process.
   *
   * I could also start with an octahedron that placed one triangle
   * in each 3D cartesian octant. That would push to 512 faces instead
   * of 256 faces, leaving me with shorts. But, it would be easier to quantize
   * at the first level because it would be based upon sign. And perhaps
   * it would be easier to take advantage of symmetry in the process of
   * converting from normal to normix.
