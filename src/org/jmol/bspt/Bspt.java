/**
 *<p>
 * a Binary Space Partitioning Tree
 *</p>
 *<p>
 * The tree partitions n-dimensional space (in our case 3) into little boxes,
 * facilitating searches for things which are *nearby*.
 *</p>
 *<p>
 * For some useful background info, search the web for "bsp tree faq". Our
 * application is somewhat simpler because we are storing points instead of
 * polygons.
 *</p>
 *<p>
 * We are working with three dimensions. For the purposes of the Bspt code these
 * dimensions are stored as 0, 1, or 2. Each node of the tree splits along the
 * next dimension, wrapping around to 0.
 * 
 * <pre>
 * mySplitDimension = (parentSplitDimension + 1) % 3;
 * </pre>
 * 
 * A split value is stored in the node. Values which are <= splitValue are
 * stored down the left branch. Values which are >= splitValue are stored down
 * the right branch. If searchValue == splitValue then the search must proceed
 * down both branches.
 *</p>
 *<p>
 * Planar and crystaline substructures can generate values which are == along
 * one dimension.
 *</p>
 *<p>
 * To get a good picture in your head, first think about it in one dimension,
 * points on a number line. The tree just partitions the points. Now think about
 * 2 dimensions. The first node of the tree splits the plane into two rectangles
 * along the x dimension. The second level of the tree splits the subplanes
 * (independently) along the y dimension into smaller rectangles. The third
 * level splits along the x dimension. In three dimensions, we are doing the
 * same thing, only working with 3-d boxes.
