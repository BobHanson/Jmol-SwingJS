Notes

The NMRDB interface was written by Luc Patini at EPFL, in Lausanne, Switzerland.
It involves a call to http://www.nmrdb.org/tools/jmol/predict.php
with a posted key of molfile containing the value of a valid MOL file

JSpecView accepts two types of access that will trigger this call. 

1) LOAD "http://SIMULATION/MOL=...mol file data..." (\n between lines)

The MOL file data may be 2D (from JSME) or 3D (from Jmol). It doesn't matter, 
because the calculation is done with a molecular graph only.  

2) LOAD "http://SIMULATION/$chemicalIdentifier"

In this case, JSpecView must first go to NIH and retrieve a MOL file from 
the chemical identifier. An representative call would be:

http://cactus.nci.nih.gov/chemical/structure/caffeine/file?format=sdf
